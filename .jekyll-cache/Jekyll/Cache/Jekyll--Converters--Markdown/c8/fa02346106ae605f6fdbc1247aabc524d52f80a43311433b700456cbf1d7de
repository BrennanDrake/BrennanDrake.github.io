I".<p>This past weekend, I was able to transfer all of the basic code on the turtlebot into a docker container. From there I confirmed the ability to access the relevant topics on my desktop pc on the same network (using rviz to visualize my custom urdf) and to teleop the robot as well.</p>

<p>I have also started to do my development inside of a vscode dev container. This allows me to easily contain all of my dependencies and maintain operation regardless of device used. I plan to eventually experiment with using this on a steam deck running linux.</p>
