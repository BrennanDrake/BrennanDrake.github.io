I"J<p><strong>Today’s Summary:</strong><br />
Today I implemented an rfid_landmark node that would publish the transform from the map frame to the PN5180 RFID reader’s frame for rfid detection events. As you can see in the video below, there is a lot of tolerance for that detection, and so the landmark moves with the robot a bit. In addition, you can see that the landmark is preexisting at the beginning of the video but rather than localizing the robot, the detection frame moves itself. This will be addressed soon. Immediate objectives are in the full post.</p>
