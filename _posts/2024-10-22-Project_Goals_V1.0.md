## Current Project Goals

1. **[COMPLETED] Containerize Turtlebot3_bringup and RFID capture code**
   - Allow for easier development with docker images saved on server registry
   
2. **Containerize SLAM_TOOLBOX in VSCode dev container for easier development**
   - By doing this, I'll have a backup image / baseline to work off of.
   
3. **Integrate RFID detection events into SLAM_Toolbox as landmarks**
   - RFID assembly I have from my undergrad outputs a detection event and a unique ID

4. **Simulate humanoid robot from existing resources in Gazebo**
   - Investigate gait algorithms
