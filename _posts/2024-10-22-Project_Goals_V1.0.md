## Current Project Goals

1. **[COMPLETED] Containerize Turtlebot3_bringup and RFID capture code**
   - Allow for easier development with docker images saved on server registry
   
2. **[IN PROGRESS] Containerize rtabmap in VSCode dev container for easier development**
   - By doing this, I'll have a backup image / baseline to work off of.
   
3. **[COMPLETED] Create node to output RFID detection events as landmarks**
   - Tie the RFID tag ID to the location transform from the map frame at the instant of detection

3. **[IN PROGRESS] Integrate RFID detection events into rtabmap as landmarks**
   - Save detections with the map and use them for relocalization
